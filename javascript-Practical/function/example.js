Functions in JavaScript
Functions are the basic building block of JavaScript. Functions allow us to encapsulate a block of code and reuse it multiple times.

Functions make JavaScript code more readable, organized, reusable, and maintainable.

  ```js
  function <function-name>(arg1, arg2, arg3,...)
{
    //write function code here
};
```
