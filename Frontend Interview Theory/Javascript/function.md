what is function ?
n JavaScript, a function is a reusable block of code that can be defined and executed. Functions allow you to encapsulate a set of statements into a single unit, which can then be called or invoked multiple times with different inputs (arguments) to perform specific tasks or calculations. Functions are a fundamental concept in JavaScript and play a crucial role in structuring and organizing your code.
