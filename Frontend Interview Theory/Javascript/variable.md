1) variable declaration in javascript  in short ?

   In JavaScript, you declare variables using var, let, or const followed by the variable name. Here's a short explanation of each:

var: Used for declaring variables with function-level scope (prior to ES6). Variables declared with var can be redeclared and reassigned.

let: Introduced in ES6, it's used for block-level scoped variables. Variables declared with let can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope.

const: Also introduced in ES6, it's used for variables with block-level scope, like let. However, variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after their initial value is set.
